Funtionality:
The discord bot has many different commands and functions, it can detect sad messages and dm you an inspirational quote to cheer you up. 
You can send different ascii arts using this bot. You can also access reddit posts using the bot commands.
There are some other goofy commands such as magic 8 ball, or bogosort an array.

How I built it:
I built the bot using discord.py which is a framework that allows users to create discord bots using python

What next?
Hoping to add more goofy commands.
